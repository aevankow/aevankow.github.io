My research vision is summarized as CryptoCoLab, integrating the study of cryptogams with community, collections, and collaborative science. I believe, like Rosalind Franklin, that “Science and everyday life cannot be separated.” Science should be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). Science should be for everyone, of all ages and backgrounds. In order to find, describe, and conserve biodiversity, professional scientists need all the help we can get.
