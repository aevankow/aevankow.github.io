My research vision is summarized as **CryptoCoLab**, integrating the study of **cryptogams** with **comparative genomics, community, collections, conservation, and collaborative science**. I believe, like Rosalind Franklin, that “Science and everyday life cannot be separated.” Science should be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). Science should be for everyone, of all ages and backgrounds. In order to find, describe, and conserve biodiversity, professional scientists need all the help we can get.


## Cryptogams

I have a broad botanical/mycological/phycological research-base, with a focus on species that photosynthesize. These include plants, algae, and lichenized fungi. My research will continue to focus on biodiversity of cryptogams, including lichenized fungi, fungi associated with lichens, algae associated with lichens, and marine algae. I will also continue to complete revisions of lichenized fungi in the family Psoraceae and the Lecanorales, more broadly, with a focus on North American taxa.

## Comparative genomics

## Community

I intend to build on the practices I have learned from my previous mentors about integrating science into local and broader communities. I have worked with people in science of all ages. I would like to establish a community of naturalists and hobbyists, while also collaborating with existing networks of naturalists. I believe community science should and shall be foundational to future work in biodiversity discovery and conservation. Many taxonomic experts in cryptogams are hobbyists that can provide incredibly valuable insight into species groups and conservation strategies. I want to work with the general public as well as reach younger audiences in local schools.

## Collections

I began working as a collections-based scientist in 2015, when I was hired as the Collections Associate at the Ocean Genome Legacy DNA Bank at Northeastern University. In this position, and eventually as the interim manager of these DNA and tissue collections, I lived and breathed collections management (databases, freezer maintenance, specimen acquisition, loans, permit compliance, lab management) and public outreach. 

My own research has focused on using collections to improve our understanding of biodiversity and climate change. These themes range from community-based science to genomics. For example, I help create the Alpine Flowers and Climate Change community and collections-based online project. As for genomics, with recent advancements in sequencing technology, it is now possible to sequence 100,000 specimens in one nanopore run. With this potential, we will be able to provide much more value for the specimens in collections, with minimal funding and destructive sampling.
