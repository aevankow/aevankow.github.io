 My research vision is summarized as **CryptoCoLab**, integrating the study of **cryptogams** with **comparative genomics, community, collections, conservation, and collaborative science**. I currently work with the themes of "evolution and ecology of urban lichens", "hidden biodiversity discovery", and "spatial phylogenetics and landscape genomics".

## Ongoing Research

### Theme: Evolution and Ecology of Urban Lichens and Algae
**Main Questions:** What is the population genomic structure of urban lichens? Have lichens recolonized cities from nonurban areas or urban refugia? Are lichens evolving to survive in urban areas? What is happening with the symbiotic algae?

**Project group:** Jason Munshi-South (Drexel U.), Jeremy Howland (CUNY), James Lendemer (NYS Museum)

**Published articles:**

### Theme: Hidden Biodiversity Discovery
**Main Questions:** What undiscovered fungal and algal diversity exist in collections? What undiscovered diversity exists in understudied regions, especially the global south? Should we use single marker barcodes or genome-wide markers to study and describe biodiversity? 

**Project group:** Research groups spanning Norway (University of Oslo, Norwegian University of Science and Technology), Sweden (Swedish Museum of Natural History), USA (Brigham Young University, U.C. Berkeley) Pakistan (University of Punjab), China (Kunming Institute of Botany), and Germany (Senckenberg Research Institute)

### Theme: Spatial Phylogenetics and Landscape Genomics
**Main Questions:** Where are regions with high or low levels of phylogenetic diversity? How are species distributions impacted by landscapes and other factors? Are regions of high phylogenetic diversity in conserved areas?
