## Information

Being grateful to all the great mentors I met during my career, I am trying to welcome more junior members of the community, from preschoolers to undergrad students.

**1. Hi**\
  [TSM](https://www.thesciencementors.com/en) was an online program providing support and career advice to undergrad students by connecting them to more experienced scholars. I was a mentor during four cycles of the program, and also was interviewed on a live stream ([Watch on YouTube (in Russian)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G5a-NEvQRI&t=2s&ab_channel=TheScienceMentors))
